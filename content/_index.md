## About me

Hello, I'm Ben. I like to tour through random technology, I'm a [Christian](https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Micah-6-8/), I like to hike, I got married in 2020, and, as of 2022, we have a toddler!

### Words that define me

Several months ago, a colleague suggested I boil down my ambitions into 5 words (thanks Jon!!). Here are the top three I haven't been able to displace.

I want to:

- [Love](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2022%3A36-40&version=KJV) (people (especially my wife!!!!) and God. I want to help folks and not keep grudges)
- Improve (myself/others/projects)
- Enjoy (life! I need to make time to do interesting things with people I love)
