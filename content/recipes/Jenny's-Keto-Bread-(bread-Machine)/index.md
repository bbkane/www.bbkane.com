- 1 cup warm water (90-100Â° F)
- 1 Tbsp dry active yeast
- 1 Tsp allulose (optional? I forgot this last time and it seemd fine)
- 3 eggs beaten
- 2/3 cup ground flax meal
- 2 Tbsp coconut flour
- 1 cup vital wheat gluten
- 1/4 cup protein powder
- 4 Tbsp sweetener (we use erythritol / monkfruit)
- 1 Tbsp ground psyllium husks
- 1 Tsp salt
- 2 Tbsp butter - cut in small chunks
- optional: seeds, hemp seeds, acai powder, blueberries, etc.

Cook

- Place warm water and eggs in bread machine
- Place other ingredients in bread machine,  making sure to leave the yeast for last
- Put machine on 2lbs settings and hit start
- If using optional ingredients, make sure to add per machine instructions (we use hamilton beach and during the 2nd cycle it beeps 2 times and that's when I add them)
