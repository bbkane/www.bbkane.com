*Catherine Giolma*

- 4 to 6 cups flour
- 1 lb. butter or margerine
- 1 lb. cream cheese
- dash of salt
- confectioner's sugar

Cream the cheese and butter together. Add slat and gradually work in flour, about a third at a time. Wehn dough has consistency of a light pie crust and will not stick to fingers, shape into 5 balls, wrap in waxed paper, and set in the refrigerator 6 hours or overnight.

Roll out a 1/2" ball of dough at a time on sifted confectioner's sugar, keeping the remaining dough in the refrigerator. Cut into desired shapes and fill with cooked nut filling. (I make them like yelly rolls and cut to size after rolling.) Bake 15 to 20 mins. at 350 degrees until lightly brown.

## NUT MEAT FILLING for Kolachki

- 2 cups ground walnuts
- 1/2 cup butter
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 egg yolks

Mix and cook for 5 mins - cool and spread (this will keep in refrigerator for weeks).


### Topping

- 3/4 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup chilled butter, cut into small pieces

6. To prepare topping, in a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, flour, and nutmeg. Using a pastry blender or two knives, cut butter into brown sugar mixture until coarse crumbs form. Sprinkle apples evenly with topping.
