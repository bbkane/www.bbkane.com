This is the Kane's version! Jenny never measures so we're guestimating how much of everything.

# Ingredients

- 3 large chicken breasts
- A lot of diced garlic (maybe 3 tablespoons)
- Maybe a tablespoon of dried thyme
- 1/2 tablespoon chili flakes
- Seasoned Salt (we used Tony Chacheres)
- 3 or 4 cups spinach
- 2-3 tablespoons chicken broth
- 1/2 cup cream cheese
- Maybe 1/3 cup hard cheese like Asiago or Parmesan
- a tablespoon or two olive oil (best if infused with sun-dried tomatoes)
- Sun-dried tomatoes (we used 5 of them, cut into thin slices)

# Instructions

Cut up chicken breasts into larger bite sizes. Spice with seasoned salt and cook in olive oil until lightly browned (do not need to cook all the way).

Remove chicken and add garlic, thyme, chili flakes, and rest of the olive oil to the pan. Cook until fragrant.

Add spinach and cook until soft.

Add cheeses and chicken back in with the chicken broth.

Cook until chicken cooked through and cheese is melted!

Â¡Bon appetit!
