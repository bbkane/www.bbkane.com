*Thanks to Georgia Root*

- 2 cups peanut butter
- 1 lb 10X sugar, sifted
- 2 sticks butter, softened
- 1 lb chocolate chips or wafers

Mix peanut butter, sugar & butter together. Melt chocolate in double boiler over low heat (don't allow water to boil).

Use a long-handled iced-tea spoon to form the mix into balls. Use a candle-dip (wire loop) to lower each ball into melted chocolate. Set coated ball on wax paper to dry.

Makes a LOT of finished peanut butter balls so you may want to scale back incredients (1/2 recipe, for example).
