# Crust Ingredients

- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1-1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 cup shortening
- 1 large egg, room temperature
- 5 tablespoons cold water
- 1 teaspoon white vinegar

# Filling ingredients

- 3 cups sliced fresh or frozen rhubarb (1/2-inch pieces)
- 2 cups sliced peeled tart apples
- 1 can (8 ounces) crushed pineapple, drained
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 cup sugar
- 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon butter

# Directions

- In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Cut in shortening until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine the egg, water and vinegar; stir into flour mixture until a ball forms. Divide dough in half. Shape each into a disk; wrap and refrigerate 1 hour or overnight.
- Preheat oven to 350Â°. For filling, in a large bowl, combine rhubarb, apples, pineapple, honey and lemon juice. Combine sugar and flour; add to rhubarb mixture.
- On a lightly floured surface, roll 1 disk of dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Trim crust even with rim. Add filling; dot with butter. Roll out remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top.
- Bake until crust is golden brown and the apples are tender, about 1-1/4 hours.
