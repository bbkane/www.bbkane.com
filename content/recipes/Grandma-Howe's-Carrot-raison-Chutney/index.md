Cooking Time: 1 hour

Yield: ten 8-ounce jars

- 16 large carrots, about 4 pounds water
- 2 oranges
- 1 lemon
- 4 cups sugar
- 1 cup white vinegar
- 2 tablespoons mixed pickling spices, tied in cheesecloth
- 1/4 cup seedling raisins

Method:

1. Scrape and slice carrots. Combine with water to cover in a large saucepan. Cook until soft, about 30 minutes. Drain. Mash with a potato masher or ricer.
2. Peel oranges and lemon. Cut the peel of 1 orange and the lemon into tiny slivers. Seed and slice oranges and lemons.
3. Heat sugar, vinegar, slivered peels, and spice bag to boiling in a heavy kettle. Boil 5 minutes to make a syrup. Add mashed carrots, sliced oranges & lemon, and raisins. Cook, stirring often, until mixture thickens, about 30 minutes. Remove spice bag. Seal in hot sterilized jars.

Serve Carrot Chutney with grilled chops. Very good with a fish curry.
