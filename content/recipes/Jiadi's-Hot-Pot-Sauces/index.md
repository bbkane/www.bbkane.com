## Ingredients

- Daepa or scallion
- Garlic, 1 or 2 cloves
- Olive oil, or vegetable oil
- Soy sauce, lots of soy sauce
- Water
- [Chin-kiang Vinegar](https://fresh.99ranch.com/products/asn-tas-chinkiang-vinegar-%E6%9D%B1%E4%B9%8B%E5%91%B3%E9%8E%AE%E6%B1%9F%E9%A6%99%E9%86%8B)
- Salt
- Sugar
- MSG
- Oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon
- White pepper powder

## Instructions

- Slice the garlic and chop the scallion. Put them in a bowl
- Add a pinch of salt and some oil to the garlic and scallion. Mix and let them rest for a few minutes. This will extract the aromatics from the garlic and scallion
- Add oyster sauce, sugar, MSG, white pepper powder
- Add vinegar and lots of soy sauce. Vinegar is about 1/10 the volume  of the soy sauce to give it a sour and sharp taste. The majority of this dipping sauce is soy sauce. Mix them
- Add water, about half volume of the soy sauce, to dilute the sauce. Give it a taste. Add more water if needed until the sauce is not too salty

(Left - Sesame paste; Middle - Fermented bean curd; Right - Leek flower sauce)

## Ingredients

- Sesame paste
- Fermented bean curd
- Leek flower sauce
  - You can usually find the 3 items above on the same shelf. Other brands of fermented bean curd and leek flower sauce will work. For the sesame paste, I prefer the brand Wang Zhihe as other brands don’t taste as good
- Water
- Soy sauce, 2 teaspoon
- Salt
- Honey
- MSG
- Oyster sauce, 1 teaspoon
- Sesame oil, 1 teaspoon
- White pepper powder
- Szechuan peppercorn powder

## Instructions

- Put one bottle of sesame paste into a bowl
- Add a teaspoon of leek flower sauce, two cubes of bean curd, and the rest of the ingredients, except water
- Mix the sauce as much as possible. It’ll gradually get thicker and we’ll thin it with water next
- Add 2 teaspoons of water and mix. Repeat until the sauce is thin and smooth. It’s recommended to add 2 teaspoons of water at a time, as too much water will break down
