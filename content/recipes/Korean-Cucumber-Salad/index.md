# Ingredients

- a few drops of liquid monk fruit extract
- approximately 2 Tbsp Korean chili flakes (gochugaru)
- approximately 2 TBsp sesame seeds
- 1/4 large onion, thin-sliced
- 1-3 Tbsp diced garlic

# Instructions

- Smash cucumbers (we used a meat tenderizer, but you can use a rolling pin) into small pieces (about the size of a thumb or smaller)
- Sprinkle salt liberally and allow water to drain out (in a colander over the sink). Allow to sit for at least 30m to a few hours
- Rince off salt and and hand-squeeze cucumbers to get  as much water out as possible
- Add all other ingredients and let sit, at least two hours, preferably overnight.
