I started going to the gym a lot more Dec 2022 to lower my A1c, and in April, I got some persistent knee pain, especially when doing squats and lunges. I got a lot of advice, and, as of Aug 2023, a couple things have helped:

- learning how to squat correctly
- doing stretches to improve my overall lower body flexibility, reducing stress on the knee when exercising.

# Stretches from Daniel

Mini band side lateral walk,2 to 15 steps, knees follow tes, feet straight, small squat, glut medial

Glute bridge with Band, like a regular bridge with Band, glute maximus, with abduction (spread apart knees, close)

Side line leg raise with band

Clamshell

- Foot ball thing,
  - Straight leg, flex toes,
  - Go across foot
  - Roll down

Foam roll before and after

Dynamic stretch before, static stretch after

Practice 2 or 3 stretches/foam rolls each day

# Stretches From Karen, the web, and Christian

Some of these are from [12 Stretches to Improve Flexibility](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/ss/slideshow-stretches-to-get-loose).

I'm trying to hold them from 20-30s

- Toe touches
- Downward dog with foot shuffle
