I want to keep some scattered AI notes here...

## 2025-05-01 VS Code Agent Mode

[VS Code Agent Mode Just Changed Everything - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dutyOc_cAEU)

Use agent mode in the chat

Use `#fetch` and ask it to follow instructions

Hit keep all when it does stuff

8m - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for custom copilot instructions  + project requirements

10m - MCP server to talk to Postgres

13m30s - edit suggestions

burkeholland.github.io

### My turn

Made `vscode-agent-01`

Asked it to create the project; it had trouble installing Go dependencies, so I did that and told it to continue.

It wrote some stuff and I had it generate a test and that was wrong

It seems to get stuck if a command fails, like installing dependencies and fixing test errors.

But I'm stilla able to fix things manually and tell it to keep going
