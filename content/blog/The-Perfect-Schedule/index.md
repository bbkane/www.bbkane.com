Even if I can't get 100% to this "perfect schedule", generally the closer I get, the happier I am. 

Making sure I have a "spot" for everything I want/need to get done relieves guilt about not listening to the loudest voice in my head at any particular time AND generally makes me more productive during the day. In particular, I tend to get sluggish in the afternoon if I don't exercise.

> I hope this post inspires you to  consciously prioritize the people and things you value. Write your own "perfect schedule"!

I'm sure this schedule will change as my career, hobbies, and relationships change, so I'm also using this as a historical log.
