Even if I can't get 100% to this schedule, generally the closer I get, the happier I am. Making sure I have a "spot" for everything I want/need to get done really helps avoid afternoon sluggishness from staying to sedentary or late night thoughs about projects that keep me up.

- 0600 - 0700 - Wake up, study something, code on a side project, etc.
- 0700 - 0800 - Family breakfast, head to work
- 0800 - 1800 - work, stretch, hour long gym class, shower
- 1800 - 2100 - Family evening time - walk, reading to JJ, movie, pray
- 2100 - 2200 - Put JJ to bed, get some time with Jenny, do dishes, clean
