I figure it might be fun to write down some of the more useful and interesting things I've acquired, both to remind myself how to find them and also to smirk at younger me's favorite items as the years go by...

# [Wrangler Cargo Pants](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Wrangler-Men-s-and-Big-Men-s-Outdoor-Stretch-Zip-Cargo-Pant/654670748)

As of 2023-12-19, these are currently $22 in the "Fallen Rock" category, and they're light and stretchy enough to do my [daily stretches](@/blog/Exercises-For-Knee-Pain/index.md) while looking nice enough to wear at my casually-dressed office. Model number: `NW788FR` and my size is `36x30`
