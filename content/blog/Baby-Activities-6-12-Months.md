Our hospital gave us a PDF with this information for our child. The information is great, but the PDF font is small so I've copied it into my blog. There was no source for this information in the PDF, just this list :)

## 6-9 Months

### 1. Mom’s Still Here

Babies at 7-9 months often go through separation anxiety and like to be in constant sight and hearing of their parents. You can help your baby with separation while at home by leaving the room for a minute & then returning and happily reassuring your infant that you are still here and did not leave them. Skills: Socialization, separation, object permanence.

### 2. Can Sit

By about 8 months many babies can sit independently with their hands free to play. Help your baby to get into and out of a sitting position by rolling your baby to his side and placing your one hand under his shoulder and your other hand on his opposite hip and guide him upwards into sitting instead of picking him straight up. This is easy to do after each diaper change. To get out of sitting have your baby rotate to the side and put both hands on the floor as if to go into a hand-knee crawling position and guide him gently to the floor. Skills: Gross motor, transitioning in/out of sitting, balance, body rotation.

### 3. Let’s Crawl

Place toys just out of reach of your baby and encourage a hand-knee position. You can help your baby assume this position if needed and even place your tower leg under his tummy if he has trouble maintaining this position. Gently rock back and forth and side to side to help your baby shift his weight, reach for toys and begin to crawl reciprocally. Skills: Gross motor, strength, fine motor, reach, sensory, weight bearing.

Straw cups promote a more mature oral motor pattern than sipper cups. You can start with a juice box and using juice or water, squeeze a bit into the straw as you encourage your baby to suck. It will take a while for them to get the hang of this new skill, but once they learn to use a straw there is no need to go backwards to using a sipper. Skills: Self- feeding, oral motor strengthening

### 6. Board Books

Older babies will start to know, when a ball rolls under the couch, it is still there and they will move toward the ball in an attempt to find it. You can help babies practice this skill by first partially hiding a toy beneath a cloth and helping them find it, and then eventually completely hiding a toy and encouraging them to find it.
