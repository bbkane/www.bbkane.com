I figure it might be fun to write down some of the more useful and interesting things I've acquired, both to remind myself how to find them and also to smirk at younger me's favorite items as the years go by...

- [Clima | F-Droid - Free and Open Source Android App Repository](https://f-droid.org/es/packages/co.prestosole.clima/) - it's REALLY hard to find a weather app that isn't slow or riddled with ads, but Clima fills that niche for me.

## Favorite Purchases

I've bought these and been happy :D

### [Wrangler Cargo Pants](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Wrangler-Men-s-and-Big-Men-s-Outdoor-Stretch-Zip-Cargo-Pant/654670748)

As of 2023-12-19, these are currently $22 in the "Fallen Rock" category, and they're light and stretchy enough to do my [daily stretches](@/blog/Exercises-For-Knee-Pain/index.md) while looking nice enough to wear at my casually-dressed office. Model number: `NW788FR` and my size is `36x30`

### [Men's Columbia Steens Mountain™ Full-Zip Fleece Jacket](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-3592654/mens-columbia-steens-mountain-full-zip-fleece-jacket.jsp?skuId=37334142)

I've had a version of this jacket (model number: `WM3200`) for the last decade and I love it. Soft, fits well (my size is `M`), durable, and high quality for the price.

### [15.6" Sport Backpack (Black) | Laptop Backpack | Targus](https://us.targus.com/products/sport-15-6-inch-laptop-backpack-tsb89104us)

I bought a few of these (model number TSB89104US) at Computer Central a few years ago (2019?) and I'm on my second one. They're the perfect size for a laptop, notebook, and a change of clothes.

### [STL 2.0 | Gerber](https://www.gerbergear.com/en-us/shop/featured/sale/stl-20-22-41122)

This little knife is fantastic for opening boxes and such, while still feeling more fun than a box cutter. I love how small and thin it is.

### [Waterproof Slimfold Bifold Wallet](https://vbaxstore.com/shop/bifold-wallet/waterproof-slimfold-bifold-wallet/)

I've been using this wallet for several years and bought a few for friends as well. It's super slim and light and has room for 8-ish cards plus some cash. It's currently (2024-06-02). [$15 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074MJT7F7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1).

### [Ginger and Turmeric Sachets – Bushwick Tea](https://bushwicktea.com/products/ginger-and-turmeric-teas-sachet?variant=44073116106944)

Since I've started intermittent fasting (I'm trying to fast between 7PM and
11AM), this stuff has been great as a healthy appetite suppressant. I can
really tell a hunger difference when I drink it vs when I don't. I also love
that it's non-caffeinated so I don't have to worry about developing a caffeine
dependency.

### [DreamSky Small Digital Alarm Clock ](https://www.dreamsky4u.com/item/300065.html)

I love this little alarm clock. It's compact, the font is huge (before lasik, this was important to see across the room), you can dim the display, and you can set it to use military time. Right now it's [$15 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FN8HL5S?ref_=pe_386300_442618370_TE_sc_as_ri_0&th=1).
