I figure it might be fun to write down some of the more useful and interesting things I've acquired, both to remind myself how to find them and also to smirk at younger me's favorite items as the years go by...

## Favorite Purchases

I've bought these and been happy :D

### [Wrangler Cargo Pants](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Wrangler-Men-s-and-Big-Men-s-Outdoor-Stretch-Zip-Cargo-Pant/654670748)

As of 2023-12-19, these are currently $22 in the "Fallen Rock" category, and they're light and stretchy enough to do my [daily stretches](@/blog/Exercises-For-Knee-Pain/index.md) while looking nice enough to wear at my casually-dressed office. Model number: `NW788FR` and my size is `36x30`

### [Men's Columbia Steens Mountainâ„¢ Full-Zip Fleece Jacket](https://www.kohls.com/product/prd-3592654/mens-columbia-steens-mountain-full-zip-fleece-jacket.jsp?skuId=37334142)

I've had a version of this jacket (model number: `WM3200`) for the last decade and I love it. Soft, fits well (my size is `M`), durable, and high quality for the price.

### [15.6" Sport Backpack (Black) | Laptop Backpack | Targus](https://us.targus.com/products/sport-15-6-inch-laptop-backpack-tsb89104us)

I bought a few of these (model number TSB89104US) at Computer Central a few years ago (2019?) and I'm on my second one. They're the perfect size for a laptop, notebook, and a change of clothes.

### [STL 2.0 | Gerber](https://www.gerbergear.com/en-us/shop/featured/sale/stl-20-22-41122)

This little knife is fantastic for opening boxes and such, while still feeling more fun than a box cutter. I love how small and thin it is.

### [Waterproof Slimfold Bifold Wallet](https://vbaxstore.com/shop/bifold-wallet/waterproof-slimfold-bifold-wallet/)

I've been using this wallet for several years and bought a few for friends as well. It's super slim and light and has room for 8-ish cards plus some cash. It's currently (2024-06-02) [$15 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074MJT7F7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1).
