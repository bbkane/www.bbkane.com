### [Moe's Southwest Grill](https://locations.moes.com/ar/north-little-rock/4834-north-hills-blvd)

Generic Southwest Burrito place that I really crave at times for some reason. I don't know why.

### [Gus's Fried Chicken](https://www.gusfriedchicken.com/)

Not unique to Arkansas, but maybe the best fried chicken I've ever had...

## Parks

### [Big Dam Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/6MtWDYdDvre6ydws6)

They light this up a night. It's a great place for a walk or run.

### [Emerald Park](https://goo.gl/maps/ETnkZhNiC9gnJyTP6)

See a quarry canyon from above.

### [Riverview Park](https://goo.gl/maps/mYYxk3WcEouypAze7)

Explore the bottom of the canyon at Emerald Park

### [Greer's Ferry](https://goo.gl/maps/3ivV3QCAeKEXnujK9)

Swimming, cliff jumping

### [Petit Jean State Park](https://goo.gl/maps/Snf2r8YA43zbSejJ9)

Waterfalls and hikes

### [Grinder's Ferry](https://goo.gl/maps/RZAXfwmCGbBWT29W9)

Swimming, floating down the Buffalo River

### [Hemmed-In Hollow Falls](https://goo.gl/maps/GkAu6kUryd1SxpPE7)

Quite a drive, quite a hike, and when there's water, quite a view!
