I've been visiting family in the Binghamton, NY area since I was a kid, so here's some things I like! I'm sure there's a lot more (most of my time is spent with family)

# Food

- [The Spiedie & Rib Pit](https://maps.app.goo.gl/x8QrTTcPctZQXAQT8) - Serves spiedies!! Side note: we tried to find the Lupo's sit-down place, but it was closed, the Lupo's char pit is not associated with the original Lupos (and reports seem to be it's gone downhill), and the other Lupo's on Google Maps is not a restaurant (they process the meat and sauce). So this place is probably the best spiedies around...
- [Cacciatore's Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/p59eLcD3i5wu5rfs7) - I thiiink this is the place my aunt took me last trip. If so, it's really good!
- [Reveille Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/J4f43NCGcXd4YLE16) - Great for breakfast!
- [The Union Diner](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gb9uZ27BjcPeieXq6) - We stopped here after driving around trying to find Lupo's and were really impressed. The Greek platter is really good!
- [Frank's Italian Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ePmUBJtVv3qzjBkd9)  - this could be the other place my aunt took me. They're both on my bookmarks
- [Moe's Southwest Grill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/PHTYNWzbU1uZ7L2W8) - I love this in Arkansas (the chipolte dressing is really good) and I'm looking forward to trying it in Binghamton
- [Nirchi's Pizza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3ezc66Ai42SHpquL6) - Always delicious with many types of pizza

# Other

- [Microtel Inn](https://maps.app.goo.gl/t5YqbBxAeVpZCUef9) - beds are comfy, staff is super nice
- [Christian Life Church UPC](https://maps.app.goo.gl/za79aQSJ4T6yCaSk9) - really nice little church
- [Dorchester Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/g2ior4RppTWsocEG6) - my other aunt took us here and grilled while we went swimming. It was a marvelous day.
- [Salt Springs State Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Xgho3gbvYoQeYg9U9) - This is a really great park in Pennsylvania with beautiful springs and an old growth hemlock forest. Walking in this forest feels kinda like walking on a sponge due to the centuries of accumulated needles.
- [Otsiningo Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/43A9yMZ1ECg1KcVm6) - park by the Chenango River with a playground and walking
